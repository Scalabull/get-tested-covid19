        <p>That’s why we created <TextLink href='https://get-tested-covid19.org/'>Get Tested COVID-19</TextLink>. We want it to be as simple as possible to find your nearest testing site and have all of the information to get tested safely. As more testing centers open and can facilitate more people being tested (with fewer requirements), we want to help support communities getting tested across the US.</p>
